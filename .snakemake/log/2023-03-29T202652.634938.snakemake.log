Job 3: working on AR and Breast data/bed_files/AR_Breast
Reason: Missing output files: data/bed_files/AR_Breast

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule gather_bed_files in file /lus/theta-fs0/projects/covid-ct/imlab/users/temi/projects/TFPred-snakemake/workflow/rules/common.smk, line 42:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/bed_files/AR_Breast
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
