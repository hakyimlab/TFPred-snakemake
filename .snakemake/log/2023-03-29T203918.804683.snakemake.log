Job 3: working on AR and Breast data/bed_files/AR_Breast
Reason: Missing output files: data/bed_files/{tf_bed_dir} (dynamic)

Subsequent jobs will be added dynamically depending on the output of this job
ImproperOutputException in rule gather_bed_files in file /lus/theta-fs0/projects/covid-ct/imlab/users/temi/projects/TFPred-snakemake/workflow/rules/common.smk, line 42:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule gather_bed_files:
    output: data/bed_files/AR_Breast
    wildcards: tf_bed_dir=AR_Breast
    affected files:
        data/bed_files/AR_Breast
Removing output files of failed job gather_bed_files since they might be corrupted:
data/bed_files/AR_Breast
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
